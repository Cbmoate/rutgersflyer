# rutgersflyer
Group work starting week 16

Rutgers Virtual Flyer. There's a lot to do / eat / see / play at Rutgers. 
We need an effective way to categorize it all! 
Your app should have a user creation / login system. 
It should have a way to add places for everyone to see. 
Only authenticated users can leave reviews and ratings. 
There should be a basic filter that lets users narrow down what they want to search for (only 5 star places, restaurants, etc).


There should be at least 4 views (but of course, you're free to do more):
Home
Login / Register
Place Detail
Places Listing
Data Modeling

You will blow away your database more times than you think. Be cool with that.
Think about relationships.
Pay strict attention to data types!
Think about sessions sincerely.
User Authentication

This should be an email address / password authentication system
You should not be able to register with the an email address if it exists in our system
Have password rules (at least 5 characters, etc)
Routing / Templating
